         This spring many amazing anime series are
         being made. One of them is
         "Princess Connect Re:Dive". This show has
         great animation and very beautiful sceneries.

       <p>
         Princess Connect Re:Dive is fantasy anime
         based on the game developed by cygames.
         It's one of those relaxing anime that can
         take all the bad feelings away and make
         you laughe and make you calm. 
       </p>
       
       <p>
         Another anime that I'm watching is
         "Kaguya-sama Love Is War"
         I can't recommend this one enough. It's
         about student council president Miyuki Shirogane 
         and vice-president Kaguya Shinomiya that 
         appear to be the perfect couple, but both are too
         proud to confess their love and scheme to 
         make the other confess their love first.
